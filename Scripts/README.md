## Whittaker biomes graph
See `Whittaker_biomes_plot.R` script.

Helper scripts:

`Whittaker_biomes_prepare.R`;

`Extract_temp_rainfall.R`

**Notes**

The Whittaker biomes polygons were digitized in QGIS after georeferencing the graph in Fig 5.5 p. 92 from Ricklefs â€“ The Economy of Nature (may be available [here](https://www.academia.edu/15092278/Ricklefs_The_Economy_of_Nature_6th_txtbk)). The multi-page PDF document was split into component pages with [PDFTK Builder](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) application. The PDF page containing the Whittaker biomes graph was imported in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/). Text and extra graphic layers where removed and the remaining layers were flipped and exported as *.png file and further georeferenced in QGIS. More details in `Whittaker_biomes_prepare.R` script.

The script `Whittaker_biomes_prepare.R` was used to prepare the digitized polygons for plotting.

`Extract_temp_rainfall.R` script was used to extract pairs of temperature and precipitation at study locations.
These extractions together with the digitized biome polygons were used as layers for constructing final graph with `Whittaker_biomes_plot.R` script.

In developing stage. There are issues with the clustering of species in the original tree.
