## Data descriptors

### Whittaker biomes plot
The Whittaker biomes polygons were digitized in QGIS after georeferencing the graph in Fig 5.5 p. 92 from Ricklefs â€“ The Economy of Nature (may be available at: https://www.academia.edu/15092278/Ricklefs_The_Economy_of_Nature_6th_txtbk)

The script `Whittaker_biomes_prepare.R` was used to prepare the digitized polygons for plotting.

`Extract_temp_rainfall.R` was used to extract pairs of temperature and precipitation at study locations.
These extractions together with the digitized biome polygons were used as layers for plotting in `Whittaker_biomes_plot.R`
