# Prepare digitized Whittaker biomes polygons for plotting in ggplot.
# Transform from shapefile to dataframe.

# The Whittaker biomes polygons were digitized in QGIS after georeferencing
# the graph in Fig 5.5 p. 92 from Ricklefs â€“ The Economy of Nature 
# (at: https://www.academia.edu/15092278/Ricklefs_The_Economy_of_Nature_6th_txtbk)
# Georeferencing was done using the EPSG:53002 (sphere equidistant cylindrical) CRS.
# I used 4 ground control points located in 4 corners of the graph, with X within -100 and 300 
# instead of -10 and 30 in order to avoid distortions.
# Digitization was carried at scale 1:500. The file was saved as biomes.shp
